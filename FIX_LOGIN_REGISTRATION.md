# 🔧 Login & Registration Issue - FIXED

## Issues Identified

1. **Registration Taking Too Long** - Bcrypt cost was set to 10 (default), causing ~80-100ms per registration
2. **No Timeout in Flutter** - HTTP requests had no timeout, causing hangs
3. **Poor Error Messages** - Generic errors didn't help debug issues

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Frontend (Flutter) - Already Fixed ✅
- ✅ Added 15-second timeout for registration
- ✅ Added 10-second timeout for login
- ✅ Better error messages showing actual server response
- ✅ Updated roles dropdown with correct roles

**File Updated:** `frontend/lib/features/auth/data/datasources/auth_api_service.dart`

### Backend (Go) - Needs Deployment ⚠️
- ✅ Reduced bcrypt cost from 10 to 8 (faster hashing, still secure)
- ✅ Code updated locally

**File Updated:** `backend/internal/auth/util/password.go`

---

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Rebuild Flutter App Only (Quick Test)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\CricketApp\frontend
flutter build apk --release
```

The new APK at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` will have:
- Better error messages
- Timeouts (won't hang forever)
- Correct roles

**Test this first!** The backend is still working, just slower.

---

### Option 2: Deploy Updated Backend (Recommended for Speed)

#### Step 1: Build Backend for Linux
```powershell
cd C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\CricketApp\backend
$env:GOOS = "linux"
$env:GOARCH = "amd64"  
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "0"
go build -o main .
```

#### Step 2: Upload to EC2

**Using WinSCP (Recommended):**
1. Download WinSCP from https://winscp.net/
2. Connect with:
   - Host: `13.233.117.234`
   - User: `ubuntu`
   - Private key: `C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\CricketApp\Secret Key\cricket-app-keypair.pem`
3. Navigate to `/home/ubuntu/cricket-backend/`
4. Upload the `main` file (overwrite existing)

**OR using PowerShell (if OpenSSH works):**
```powershell
scp -i "Secret Key\cricket-app-keypair.pem" .\main ubuntu@13.233.117.234:~/cricket-backend/
```

#### Step 3: Restart Backend

**Using PuTTY or any SSH client:**
```bash
ssh -i "Secret Key\cricket-app-keypair.pem" ubuntu@13.233.117.234
cd cricket-backend
chmod +x main
pkill -f './main'
nohup ./main > backend.log 2>&1 &
exit
```

#### Step 4: Test It

```powershell
# Test registration speed
$body = @{
    email = "testuser$(Get-Random)@example.com"
    password = "Test123!"
    full_name = "Test User"
    role = "player"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Measure-Command {
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://13.233.117.234:8080/api/v1/auth/register" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
}
```

Should take < 300ms now (instead of ~700ms)

## 🧪 Test the Mobile App

1. **Rebuild the APK:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\CricketApp\frontend
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. **Install on your phone:**
   - Copy `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` to phone
   - Install it

3. **Try Registration:**
   - Name: Your Name
   - Email: youremail@example.com
   - Phone: (optional)
   - Role: player (or any other role)
   - Password: Test123!
   - Confirm Password: Test123!

4. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Registration completes in < 2 seconds
   - ✅ Login works immediately
   - ✅ Clear error messages if something fails

---

## 📋 Valid Roles

Use any of these roles during registration:
- `player`
- `umpire`
- `commentator`
- `streamer`
- `organiser`
- `personal_coach`
- `physio`

---

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

### Check Backend Status
```powershell
curl http://13.233.117.234:8080/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "message": "CricketApp API is running",
  "status": "success",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Check Backend Logs (via SSH)
```bash
ssh -i "Secret Key\cricket-app-keypair.pem" ubuntu@13.233.117.234
cd cricket-backend
tail -f backend.log
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection timeout"** → Check if backend is running (`curl http://13.233.117.234:8080/health`)
2. **"Invalid email or password"** → Make sure you're using the correct password
3. **"User already exists"** → Try a different email
4. **"Invalid role: xxx"** → Use one of the valid roles listed above

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Frontend**: ✅ Fixed (timeout + better errors)
- **Backend**: ⚠️ Needs deployment (faster password hashing)
- **APK**: Needs rebuild with `flutter build apk --release`

Start with Option 1 (rebuild Flutter only) and test. If still slow, deploy backend update.

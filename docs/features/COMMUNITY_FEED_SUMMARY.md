# Community Feed Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Completed implementation of the Community Feed Service for the CricketApp backend - the final feature of Backend Phase 2. This service enables social interactions among cricket players through posts, comments, and likes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Posts Management
- **Create Post**: Users can create posts with content, media URLs, type (general/match/training/achievement/question), and visibility (public/friends/private)
- **Update Post**: Users can edit their own post content
- **Delete Post**: Users can delete their own posts
- **Get Post Details**: Retrieve full details of a specific post with like status
- **Get User Posts**: View all public posts by a specific user
- **Feed Browsing**: Paginated feed with filtering by post type

### 2. Comments System
- **Add Comment**: Users can comment on posts
- **Get Comments**: Retrieve all comments for a post with user info
- **Delete Comment**: Users can delete their own comments
- **Comment Counts**: Automatic increment/decrement of post comment counts

### 3. Likes Functionality
- **Like Post**: Users can like posts (with duplicate prevention)
- **Unlike Post**: Users can remove their like from a post
- **Like Comment**: Users can like comments
- **Unlike Comment**: Users can remove their like from a comment
- **Like Counts**: Automatic increment/decrement of like counts
- **Like Status**: `is_liked_by_user` flag shows if current user has liked the item

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Pattern
```
internal/community/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ community.go      # Entities (Post, Comment, Like)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go     # Repository interface (25 methods)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go        # Service interface (12 methods)
â”œâ”€â”€ repository/postgres/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ community_repository.go  # PostgreSQL implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ service/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ community_service.go     # Business logic
â””â”€â”€ delivery/http/
    â””â”€â”€ handler.go        # HTTP handlers (13 endpoints)
```

### Database Schema
**Posts Table** (12 fields):
- `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `media_urls` (TEXT array)
- `post_type`, `visibility`, `likes_count`, `comments_count`, `shares_count`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Comments Table** (8 fields):
- `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `likes_count`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Likes Table** (6 fields):
- `id`, `user_id`, `post_id`, `comment_id`
- `created_at`
- Unique constraint on `user_id, post_id, comment_id`

**Indexes** (8 total):
- `idx_posts_user_id`, `idx_posts_type`, `idx_posts_visibility`, `idx_posts_created_at`
- `idx_comments_post_id`, `idx_comments_user_id`
- `idx_likes_user_post`, `idx_likes_user_comment`

## API Endpoints (13 Total)

### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
1. `GET /api/v1/posts` - Get community feed (with pagination, type filtering)
2. `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}` - Get post details
3. `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}/comments` - Get post comments

### Protected Endpoints (Auth Required)
4. `POST /api/v1/posts` - Create post
5. `PUT /api/v1/posts/{id}` - Update post
6. `DELETE /api/v1/posts/{id}` - Delete post
7. `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/posts` - Get user's posts
8. `POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/comments` - Add comment
9. `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}` - Delete comment
10. `POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/like` - Like post
11. `DELETE /api/v1/posts/{id}/like` - Unlike post
12. `POST /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/like` - Like comment
13. `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{commentId}/like` - Unlike comment

## Key Implementation Details

### Repository Layer (25 Methods)
- **Posts**: CreatePost, GetPostByID, ListPosts, GetUserPosts, UpdatePost, DeletePost
- **Comments**: CreateComment, GetCommentByID, GetPostComments, DeleteComment, Increment/DecrementCommentCount
- **Likes**: LikePost, UnlikePost, LikeComment, UnlikeComment, Increment/DecrementPostLikes, Increment/DecrementCommentLikes, IsPostLikedByUser, IsCommentLikedByUser
- **Features**:
  - JOINs with users table for `user_name` and `user_photo`
  - `sql.NullString` handling for optional fields
  - `pq.Array` for PostgreSQL TEXT[] arrays
  - Duplicate like prevention via unique constraint

### Service Layer (12 Methods)
- **Validation**:
  - Post content: 1-2000 characters
  - Comment content: 1-1000 characters
  - Post type: general/match/training/achievement/question
  - Visibility: public/friends/private
- **Authorization**:
  - Users can only edit/delete their own posts
  - Users can only delete their own comments
  - Prevent duplicate likes
- **Business Logic**:
  - Auto-increment/decrement counters
  - Fetch full post details after creation
  - Handle like/unlike toggling

### HTTP Handlers (13 Endpoints)
- JSON request/response handling
- JWT authentication middleware for protected routes
- Proper HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized)
- Error handling with meaningful messages
